# Quire

Quire is a fully client-side PDF editor for the core tasks people reach for most: merge, extract, reorder, rotate, delete, and unlock. Every operation runs in your browser with `pdf-lib` and `pdf.js`, so your files never leave your device.

## Product Scope

- Merge multiple PDFs into one working set
- Extract selected pages into a new PDF
- Reorder pages with drag and drop
- Rotate individual pages or selections in 90 degree steps
- Mark pages for deletion before export
- Unlock password-protected PDFs with an in-browser prompt
- Render page thumbnails locally with pdf.js for inspection before export

## Stack

- [Astro 6](https://astro.build) for the site shell and content pages
- [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) for the editor interface
- [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling
- [pdf-lib](https://pdf-lib.js.org) and [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) for PDF processing/rendering
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit tests
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for browser E2E coverage
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) for package management and scripts

## Development

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:4321` by default.

## Quality Checks

```sh
bun run verify
```

Or run the individual steps:

```sh
bun run type-check
bun run lint
bun run format:check
bun run test
bun run test:e2e
bun run build
